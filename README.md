# Local-Notifications-Redirect
Redirecting to particular UIViewController using the root Controller of the AppDelegate's window. 

In answer to [Stack overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31610896/controlling-which-view-controller-loads-after-receiving-a-push-notification-in-s/31612906#31612906)

Force quit the app or go in the background to trigger a Local Notification after 5 seconds. When you press the notification, the root controller will have changed.
